            <p>What is it?<br><br>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a set of neurological disorders that are characterized by a specific group of behavioral and developmental patterns. These behaviors frequently impact the way the autistic person interacts with those around them and the way that they perceive the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="sidenote">(Side note: the term Asperger syndrome is no longer used by phycologists, but I still hear it alot so I wanted to address it. Asperger's was used to identify a specific subset of autistic people who have a more specific set of symptoms. The term was integrated into the umbrella family of "autism spectrum disorder" in 2013, but many people who have received this diagnosis still identify with and use the term. You can learn more about Asperger's <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/types-autism-what-asperger-syndrome">here</a>.)</p>

            <div class="overlay-one">Sometimes members of the autistic community will wear ear-plugs or noise-cancelling headphones. This is because some of them have sound sensitivities that may keep them from concentrating or may overwhelm them if they have to keep listening to their surroundings.</div>

            <p>What are the Symptoms?<br><br>Autism symptoms vary greatly from person to person, but some common symptoms are: trouble relating to others, sensory and auditory processing disorders,  repetitive actions, trouble adapting to change, speech difficulties, and many many others.

        <div class="what-text-2">
          <p>What does it look like to be Autistic? <br><br>Many of the autistic characters you have seen in media probably expressed some of these symptoms, but just because something is an autistic trait does not mean that every member of the autism community has that trait. This is where the idea of a spectrum comes in. A person on one end of the spectrum might have speech difficulties and initiate repetitive actions or have learning difficulties and be sensitive to touch, but someone on the other end could be a non-verbal artistic genius or a fluent-conversationalist who cannot bear to see their schedule changed. The set of symptoms will vary greatly from person to person.</p>

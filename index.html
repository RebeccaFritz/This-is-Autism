              <div class="overlay-three">Why do autistic people sometimes rock back and forth? This falls under the category of stimming, which is repetative self-stimulating behavior. Everyone does this a little bit, but members of the autistic community may do it more often and have a harder time stopping. It can help them focus or stay calm in a stressful situation.</div>

              <div class="overlay-four">Those with autism sometimes struggle to engage in social interactions. This isn't because they don't want to talk to you. Rather, this is due to communication difficulties. Many autistic people take things very literally and might not understand you if you are being ambiguous, making an analogy, or using sarcasm. They may also have trouble successfully communicating what they are trying to say.</div>

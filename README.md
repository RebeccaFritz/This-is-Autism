# This-is-Autism-Prime-
This is a website intended to raise awareness about Autism Spectrum Disorder.

This website is mostly functional on the computer, but has not been completely formatted for phone use. I went to college and stopped having time to work on this project.
The "see the spectrum" page does not work how I want it to, but I have not yet obtained the skills required to fix it.

Update: Replit has changed their policy and is no longer hosting websites for free, so unfortunately this site (once found at https://this-is-autism-prime.rebeccafritz.repl.co/) is no longer active.

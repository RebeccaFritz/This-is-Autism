        <p class="text-about-one">Dear Reader,<br><br>In my day-to-day life, I have noticed a problem: a lot of people seem to have an incomplete view of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This seems to be largely based on media stereotypes (This is understandable. We come to a lot of conclusions based on the media we consume.), but these stereotypes don't tell the whole story. ASD is called a "spectrum disorder." This is because ASD is an umbrella term containing a set of symptoms that appear in different combinations depending on the person. (You can think of ASD like a deck of cards in which are all of the symptoms. Each individual autistic person in dealt a hand containing similar, but slightly different cards.) I would like to stress the importance of what I am saying: no two autistic people will have the exact same experience with their autism. This website is my attempt to educate the general public about what being autistic really means.<br><br>As you read this please keep in mind that not everyone with autism considers it a disorder. It can cause a lot of developmental and behavioral problems, but some people find the world-view that their autism has given them to be a part of who they are and do not want a cure (there are, of course, plenty of exceptions). This completely depends on the person's experience with autism. Also, remember that I am only one member of the autistic community and can only represent my own point of view. I have tried to stay as unbiased as possible, but, as this is something I am passionate about, at times I may have failed to do so.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Rebecca Fritz</p>

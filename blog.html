            <h2>Change Is Scary</h2>
            <h5 class="datetxt">Why am I so terrified of going to college? Aug 8, 2021</h5>

            <p class="cardtxt">One of the more common symptoms of autism is difficulty dealing with change. In particularly sudden change. Alot of us like the sense of security that a set schedule and familiar surroundings give us and when those things change, even just a little bit, it can be really scary and really hard. Right now I am facing some very big changes: moving out and going to college. I am very scared and sad because I don't know how this will turn out. I don't have a crystal ball to look into and show myself that everything is going to be okay. What I do have is a lot of silly questions that are causing my undo stress: Will my room be rearranged while I am gone? Will my dog remember me (and still love me the most) when I come home? Will I still love hugs? Will I have time to crochet and watch youtube? Will I still have time to work out? Don't get me wrong, I'm also scared of failing, of not making friends, of going into debt, and not enjoying my major. Those, however, aren't at the forefront of my mind. Those are the future and they won't change the present. Somehow they aren't as scary as losing what I have today. As losing who I am.</p>

            <h2>Up and At'em</h2>

            <p class="cardtxt">I frequently have trouble getting up in the morning. Sometimes this is because I'm tired and want to go back to sleep, sometimes the fan spinning above me makes the room just cold enough that I don't want to throw off my thick, warm, fuzzy blankets, and sometimes I'm just lazy. Normally it's the latter. Anyhow, this morning it was a mix of all three. I knew I needed to get up and get ready for my day since I'm in the middle of a coding camp, but I'd stayed up late working on my project the night before. Eventually, it occurred to me that I should really stop dozing. In order to finally motivate myself to actually get out of bed, I announced to the world "Up and at'em" and forced myself out from under the covers. I was standing in front of my dresser, thinking about what to wear for the day, when it occurred to me: the phrase "up and at'em" is not saying "up and Adam" (as I have thought for the last 17 years), but "up and at them". (Honestly, I don't think "up and at them" makes much more sense. What are "them"? But I digress.) I'm sure that most people already knew this (if you didn't then you are very welcome to share in my moment of enlightenment), but realizing how silly I've been with this strange belief made me laugh. I thought I'd try to make some other people laugh along with me.</p>
